# The Math — how value is calculated and patterns are found

This is the mentor's arithmetic. Anyone with this dashboard gets the same
math; only the data is theirs. No AI key at runtime — Claude Code computes
at write time (on /sweep or when asked) and writes plain numbers; the board
renders them.

## 1 · Value right now: the equation

Every tile reports one normalized input score for the day, x ∈ 0–100:

| tile    | x =                                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| fuel    | min(100, water_today / goal × 100)                |
| train   | sessions_this_week / weekly_target × 100 (cap 100)|
| vitals  | the recovery estimate (already 0–100)             |
| peak    | today's average predicted score                   |
| brand   | this week's growth / target pace × 100 (cap 100)  |
| finance | on-plan ratio vs monthly target (cap 100)         |

Each tile carries a weight w toward the ACTIVE goal (weights sum to 100,
lib/tiles/weights.ts). The day's value:

    y = Σ (wᵢ · xᵢ) / 100        → one 0–100 number

That's the board: y on top, the weighted x's in the row.

## 2 · Value over time: progress

- Measurable goal (e.g. 185 lb lean):
      progress = (start − current) / (start − target) × 100
- Growth goal (e.g. famous YouTuber — pick ONE proxy metric, e.g. subs):
      progress = ln(current/start) / ln(target/start) × 100
  Log-scaled because growth is exponential: 1K→10K is the same-size step
  as 10K→100K.

The mentor writes `progress` into the goal; the bar renders it.

## 3 · Patterns: the noticing

Histories are append-only and time-stamped, so a pattern is just columns
lined up by date.

1. Build daily series per stream (water count, trained yes/no, sleep hours,
   views, …).
2. Correlate day-over-day CHANGES, not raw levels (a general uptrend must
   not fake a pattern).
3. Scan lags 0, 1, 2 days (yesterday's sleep → today's output). The
   strongest |r| names the direction.
4. Thresholds: |r| > 0.5 AND n ≥ 10 days → a real pattern. Write it to the
   noticed feed with the key words **bold**.
5. Under 10 days of data: say "still learning you." Never invent insight.

## 4 · Evidence retunes the weights

Weights start as interview priors. Every ~2 weeks, for each tile compute r
between its stream and the goal's proxy, then glide:

    wᵢ ← wᵢ + 0.2 × (rᵢ·100 − wᵢ)     then renormalize to Σw = 100

Never jump a weight; glide it. When a tile that had no weight shows real
signal, it ENTERS the goal (that's the seeded example: Train entered the
YouTuber goal at 8% because workouts predicted output).

## House rules

- One proxy metric per goal — more makes progress unfalsifiable.
- Append-only histories; the math never rewrites the past.
- Every Notice must trace back to numbers that exist in a tile's store.
- Show the work when asked: the mentor can print the r table any time.
