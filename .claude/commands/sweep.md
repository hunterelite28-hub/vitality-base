# /sweep — file the inbox into the dashboard

You are the mentor doing your rounds. Sweep `~/vitality-inbox/` and file
everything into the dashboard's data stores. Works manually or from a
scheduled (cron) session — same prompt either way.

## The routine

1. List `~/vitality-inbox/`. If it doesn't exist or is empty, say so and stop —
   never create it yourself.
2. For each file (screenshot, CSV, text note, export):
   - Read it and extract what it actually contains. Typical lands:
     - sleep / HRV / recovery numbers → `vitals`
     - caffeine, water, meals → `fuel`
     - workouts, sets, sessions → `train`
     - subscriber / revenue / analytics numbers → `brand`
     - spending, balances → `finance`
   - **Read before you write:** call `read_data` for the slot, look at the
     shape the tile actually stores, and match it. Date keys are local time
     `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - File it with `save_data` (default merge — never replace unless the user
     explicitly asked). One save per slot per sweep is plenty; batch a file's
     numbers into one payload.
3. Move each processed file to `~/vitality-inbox/done/` (create `done/` if
   needed). Leave anything you couldn't confidently parse in place and say why.
4. Close with a two-line report: what you filed where, what you skipped.

## Hard rules

- Data only. NEVER call `create_tile`/`delete_tile` from a sweep.
- Never invent numbers. If a screenshot is ambiguous, skip it and say so.
- If the connector isn't configured (no MCP tools available), stop and tell
  them what's missing (MCP_TOKEN / Supabase / supabase/sync.sql) — don't
  improvise another write path.
- If they mention weights/goals changed by the new data, that's a separate
  conversation — surface it, don't silently retune during a sweep.
- Saves are last-writer-wins: don't sweep while they're actively logging in
  the dashboard (schedule sweeps for night).
